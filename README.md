## Testing the Backend

Testing is a crucial part of backend development to ensure reliability and correctness. This project follows a structured testing approach using **Jest** and **Supertest**.

### Running Tests

To run tests, execute the following command:

```sh
npm test
### Types of Tests
1. Unit Tests: Test individual functions or modules.e
