# Backend Application Structure and Testing

## Introduction

This project provides a structured approach to building a backend application, including essential aspects like user administration, token authentication, and testing. It is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure.

## Project Structure

The backend application is organized as follows:

```

```

## Testing the Backend

Testing is a crucial part of backend development to ensure reliability and correctness. This project follows a structured testing approach using Jest and Supertest.

### Running Tests

To run tests, execute the following command:

```sh
npm test
```

### Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions or modules.  
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and database interactions.  
- **Authentication Tests**: Ensure user authentication and token validation work correctly.  

## User Administration

User administration includes functionalities such as:

- User registration  
- User login  
- User roles and permissions  
- Profile management  

### Example API Endpoints:

- `POST /api/users/register` - Register a new user  
- `POST /api/users/login` - User login  
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Fetch user profile  
- `PUT /api/users/update` - Update user details  

## Token Authentication

Token-based authentication ensures secure API access. This project uses **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for authentication.

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in with credentials.  
2. A JWT token is generated and returned.  
3. The user includes the token in the request headers for protected routes.  
4. The backend verifies the token before granting access.  

### Example Token Authentication Endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Generate JWT token  
- `GET /api/protected` - Access protected resources (requires token)  


## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (>= 14.x)  
- **npm** or **yarn**  
- **MongoDB/PostgreSQL** (depending on the database used)  

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backend-project.git
         ```

         2.Install dependencies:

            ```sh
               cd backend-project
                  npm install
                     ```

                     3. Configure environment variables in a `.env` file:

                        ```sh
                           PORT=5000
                              DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
                                 JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
                                    ```

                                    4. Start the application:

                                       ```sh
                                          npm start
                                             ```

        

                                             ## Usage

                                             Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL.
